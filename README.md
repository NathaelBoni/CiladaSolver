# Cilada Solver

A Java project to solve the "Cilada" puzzle 

First, it searchs all possible positions that each piece can fit in the board.
Then, each piece is put in the board. If a piece cannot be placed, it tries on the next position until it fits
or there are no more positions. If that's the case, then the last piece is removed and placed on the its next position.

Here is an image of the physical game:
